# Foundations of augmented reality (AR)

## What is AR
Augmented reality is a digital layer that is placed on the physical world in a way that allows you to be present in both world at the same time. From face filters in Instagram and Snapchat to playing Fortnite and Roblox to using a 3d model for making sure that the new sofa fits nicely in your room before you buy it almost everyone at some point has used AR in their lives.

Augmented reality or AR is a new technology that has the potential to remove the barriers between the real and the digital world and AR is present everywhere in our world. Whether it be gaming, marketing or learning AR is all around us.

## A day in the life of an AR developer

AR developers are in much demand in the current tech job market and according to the *HIred* website there has been an 1400% growth in job postings for AR and VR engineers in 2019 and that amount is increasing.

> Keep in mind that this was before the "Metaverse" was an actual thing.

Since AR is going to be integrated into almost all of our aspects of life in the coming years it would be great to know what does the role an AR developer looks like.

Currently the e-commerce, education, gaming, and entertainment spaces are where AR is making huge waves and you might get hired by enterprise companies, new startups or work for yourself like freelancing or creating custom AR filters.

Working for an enterprise or startup company means that you'll be interacting with other developers as well as managers and you'll need to brush up on your soft skills like effective communication, problem-solving, leadership, and teamwork. Working for an agency is quite similar but you'll also have to interact with clients and build good rapport with them and translate tech-jargon into words that they can easily understand.

Building an AR SaaS, AR filters or freelancing means that you'll be your own boss and no matter how good it might seem it requires great amount of management skills and self-discipline to truly be worthwhile.

> AR is an cutting edge field and you need to do things that other people are afraid of doing with a positive attitude.

# The XR spectrum
Extended reality or XR is the term used to describe all the other technologies that we can use to combine the physical and digital worlds. XR can be thought as an spectrum or an continuum.

AR is the oldest technology in the XR family and it has been around for quite a while now. It's easy to access and doesn't need any special hardware and is considered the baseline on the XR spectrum. AR is most commonly used for digital filters that allow you to add special and life-like effects on top of your photos and videos.

Augmented virtuality (AV) is also a technology that falls into the XR spectrum and is similar to AR but is lesser known. The background filters that you and other people use to change your surrounding background online video calls and conferences are examples of AV.

> Augmented reality brings things from the digital world to the physical and Augmented virtuality brings things from the real world to the digital one.

Mixed reality is in the middle between AR an AV and it blends both the worlds and combines both the features of AR and
AV together. MR is generally used for enterprise level applications and many luxury car designers use MR headsets to
look and design the interior and exterior of their super cars with other designers and engineers.

MR is also used in aeronautics and for building rockets since it can enable engineers to design even the smallest part
easily and they can see how it would fit in the rocket in real-life.

Virtual reality or VR sits at the top of the XR spectrum and provides a fully immersive digital experience that allows you to be truly absorbed and engaged in the digital world. VR allows you to totally turn off the real-world and be truly present in the virtual world of your choice.

# AR in our daily lives
Most general users experience most of their AR content on their mobile devices. It ranges from face filters in Instagram and Snapchat to testing how the new IKEA desk would look like in your room without even going to IKEA or seeing how a dress would look on you without trying it on.

Sportsmen like golfers and baseball can benefit from AR that helps them improve their performance by showing them
their launch angle and velocity before and after taking the shot so that they can analyze their performance.
