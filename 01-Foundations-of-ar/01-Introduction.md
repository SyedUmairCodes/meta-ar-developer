# Foundations of augmented reality (AR)

## What is AR
Augmented reality is a digital layer that is placed on the physical world in a way that allows you to be present in both world at the same time. From face filters in Instagram and Snapchat to playing Fortnite and Roblox to using a 3d model for making sure that the new sofa fits nicely in your room before you buy it almost everyone at some point has used AR in their lives.

Augmented reality or AR is a new technology that has the potential to remove the barriers between the real and the digital world and AR is present everywhere in our world. Whether it be gaming, marketing or learning AR is all around us.

## A day in the life of an AR developer

AR developers are in much demand in the current tech job market and according to the *HIred* website there has been an 1400% growth in job postings for AR and VR engineers in 2019 and that amount is increasing.

> Keep in mind that this was before the "Metaverse" was an actual thing.

Since AR is going to be integrated into almost all of our aspects of life in the coming years it would be great to know what does the role an AR developer looks like. 

Currently the e-commerce, education, gaming, and entertainment spaces are where AR is making huge waves and you might get hired by enterprise companies, new startups or work for yourself like freelancing or creating custom AR filters. 

Working for an enterprise or startup company means that you'll be interacting with other developers as well as managers and you'll need to brush up on your soft skills like effective communication, problem-solving, leadership, and teamwork. Working for an agency is quite similar but you'll also have to interact with clients and build good rapport with them and translate tech-jargon into words that they can easily understand.

Building an AR SaaS, AR filters or freelancing means that you'll be your own boss and no matter how good it might seem it requires great amount of management skills and self-discipline to truly be worthwhile. 

> AR is an cutting edge field and you need to do things that other people are afraid of doing with a positive attitude.

# The XR spectrum
Extended reality or XR is the term used to describe all the other technologies that we can use to combine the physical and digital worlds. XR can be thought as an spectrum or an continuum.
